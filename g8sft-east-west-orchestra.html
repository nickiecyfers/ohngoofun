Yesterday I posted about the Symphony Essentials bundle by Native Instruments. I think that's the orchestra program I want to go for to write symphonic metal with. However, I am also looking at Komplete 11 Ultimate. This has the Symphony Essentials plus a lot of extra strings and orchestral sections as well as pianos (plus everything else it comes with). It's currently on sale for 0, and Symphony Essentials is 0. Now, I see speculation that Komplete 12 may be coming soon, but I'd assume.

If there are any people in this sub that are involved with plugin creation, marketing, design, etc. I have a crazy idea for you: Offer your old shit for free.

Hello, I use East West Orchestra and I have some questions regarding arrangements for trailer kind of music: If I want to arrange a piece with a running string sequence (maybe it's not the proper naming) and I have like 18 violins, 11 violins and 10 viola samples how would you use the voices? For example, would you use the 18 or 11 violins for the seq? Or the violas? In case I want to play a big violins melody (I supose I should use the largest instrument samples for the melody right?)

The software and sounds. For instance, I have a multi-instrument like East West Orchestra. What I want to do is record chords into the piano roll via midi, and then change each voice in the chord to a different midi-channel. The only way I know how to do this now is double clicking each note and bringing up each individual setting. I have tried selecting many and tried to change the midi channel for the notes, but it has not worked. Thanks for reading.

Basically I've been writing all sorts of classical and rock music, and I'm perfectly willing to shell out 0 for say the EastWest Orchestra Gold edition. What I want to know though, is whether this sort of thing is good enough quality to go into professionally produced pieces or if it's just a placeholder until you can afford to pay a studio orchestra (which is most likely never). I've heard the demos but can someone who's actually played with the software tell me, not if it sounds good compar. 
It's another multi-DVD orchestral library! Does it merit a thunderous introductory timp roll or a feeble tap on a vibraslap? I’m currently running Logic Pro and use Cinematic Strings for Kontakt. I’m finding some limitations in terms of expression and vibrato. With larger, layered compositions the strings start to feel very flat and have very little dynamic. Does anyone have a go-to for expressive, “played” strings? I may be willing to spend the money to get them as realistic as possible. Thank.

I'd like to start adding things into my tracks like string sections and other orchestral instruments, but every program I've found so far sounds choppy if it's actual samples, or just fake and cheesy.

Pittsburgh, I have an apology to make. I've lived here for almost 2 years now. I moved here from San Diego. And for most, although not all, of the time here, I have kinda loathed the city.

Hey, so I have been looking for super passionate vox samples like the ones odesza use and more specifically petit buiscit and it was really hard to achieve good sounding organic ones with standard vox accapelas.

Anyone else do things like this for vocal chops? Thought I might as well share this method too. The scoring.
