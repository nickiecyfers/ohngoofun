The official home page of the Apache OpenOffice open source project, home of OpenOffice Writer, Calc, Impress OpenGL API Documentation Overview.

Mesa, the Open Source OpenGL implementation has released a new major version which includes support for OpenGL 3.1. The release announcement can be found here.

If ya CPU is supported might help. :) Download exe under Available Downloads Windows 10, 64-bit\ ## Not the auto installer. Game started a random OpenGL 4.5 error, restarting would make it go away.

Welcome to the OpenGL SuperBible Home Page. This site is about all things OpenGL. Here, you‚Äôll find information about the OpenGL SuperBible, about OpenGL and about graphics in general. Just a quick one for those with Haswell chipsets and haven't already upgraded to Mesa 17: Do it. It's worth it. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers then apt-get upgrade (or dist-upgrade) glxinfo grep "OpenGL version" will still show 3.0 because it's still in testing but, glxinfo grep Core shows that you're actually now rocking openGL 4.5. Bioshock infinite is running on my Dell 11 (4GB) at lowest settings, but it's smooth, any in-game writing is legible Sean says you need a 4.5 To run this game but 4.5 support is for 900+ cards false advertisement and lies nVidia GTX 480 does not support 4.5 Sean lied again I have two gtx 1080 having fps problems i turned off run ran only one still had problems. full pc specs i7 6800k 
Seeing all the posts about open GL 4.5 being needed to run the game, i did a bit of digging and with driver version 369 (which says its supported on pretty much anything 4xx and up) for my GTX 670 and looking at the GL extension viewer, it says that 4.5 isnt supported by my card. Any ideas. This is a massive massive joke right? How can a card this good not be supported by a game with graphic fidelity of a 2005 game lol wtf? Would this explain crash on start. The following is a new benchmarking of the graphical performance of latest NVIDIA driver version ( 430.64 ) (https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/bmnsx8/driver_43064_faqdiscussion/) on a gaming rig with a high-end Pascal GPU.

This bug impacted RPCS3's performance on AMD GPUs while using OpenGL because pixel transfer operations with endianness swap (https://i.stack.imgur.com/uB92m.png) on the GPU always failed on the affected drivers, so we had to manually byteswap texel data on the CPU. This fix first shipped on AMD drivers 19.4.3, so you should update your drivers to at least that version. r/Roms Official FAQ Collaborated by: u/Devuluh, u/-Archivist, u/xprism1, u/CommonGap, u/SuperBio Alright lads, we have poured sweat and tears into this.

When the frame rate is uncapped and goes over your monitors refresh-rate it can cause ugly micro stutters.
